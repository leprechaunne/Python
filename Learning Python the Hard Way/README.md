# Learning Python the Hard Way
## Synopsis
These exercises are from "Learning Python the Hard Way" to demonstrate and perfect Python code.

## Descriptions
###1-43 are in a folder and are mostly small (usually 1 file) examples
###44 does not have an example
###45 is a demo of snake
46 and on are stored in projects
### 46 is projects/skeleton (to be used for further uploads)
### 47 is the first use of the skeleton, for a basic game
### 48 is advanced input
### 49 is a fork of 48, adding sentence parsing to make the lexicon's returns useful
### 50 uses Flask (from pip) to create a webapp from ex43.py (a TBA)
### 51 is a branch of 50 that uses more html pages, nosetests, and GET and POST data with Flask
### 52 is a branch of 50>51 that uses data from 39 to get content for the TBA. This is the finished product.

## Motivation

I wanted to learn new languages, and was recommended Python by a friend. It's a more versatile language than Java, so it'd be beneficial for future Gists.

## Installation

Basic Python IDE setup. Download Python from their website and navigate to this directory. Use the "python [filename.py]" command to run these files.

## API Reference

Default packages only, so far.

## Code Examples and Tests

Are given as needed in the smallest scope directory's readme.md.
