## Synopsis

This is a simple demonstration of an OOP program of snake using a graphics API by John Zelle
It's primary purpose is to demonstrate creating a program from scratch with proper syntax


## Changelog

### A_1.5
#### Fixed the snake 'jumping'... i was skipping a full grid space instead of going to the next

### A_1.4
#### Changed subtitle text and the key to exit title screen to Enter (so difficulty can be added later)
#### Tweaked tick to be a little faster
#### Snake can be controled AND maintains the length

### A_1.3 
#### Fixed direction confusion (got my x and y backwords) (and the y sign (+/-))
#### Fixed tick function by swapping getKey() with checkKey()

### A_1.2 
#### Made snake move on button press

### A_1.1 
#### Added boundary and key reading command and tick, but no action on tick yet

### A_1.0 
####Drew a Window and a Square (impressive, I know)
