# Python
## Synopsis

These exercises are basic introductory files run in PowerShell or terminal or shell to demonstrate basic Python concepts.

## Code Example

### exl.py
Simple printing exercises with lines commented out.
These exercises are from "Learning Python the Hard Way" to demonstrate and perfect Python code.
### ex2.py
Basic commenting structure and importance.
### ex3.py
Basic mathematical operations. Sort of poorly formatted, but I think that was largely the point. 
The messy equations help solidify how python Order of Operations works.
#### ex3_extra.py
	Just a random math problem, as prompted by the study drills section.
### ex4.py
Practical example of calculations using variables and clean outputs.
###ex5.py
Set and evaluate constants in line with the f"String {Varliable} String"
### ex6.py
Use of the String.format() function and concatanation
### ex7.py, ex8.py, ex9.py
The author admitted these are fairly similar and don't require explicit explanation. Just more printing.
### ex10.py
Use of encoded characters (such as \n)
### ex11.py & 12
First use of input()
### ex13.py
First variable input in batch line
### ex14.py
Mixing in command line and in-program videos
### ex15.py
Reading text files
### ex16.py
File deleting and rewriting.
### ex17.py
Replace contents of one file with the contents of another (much like an installation program would do)
### ex18.py
Introduction to functions
### ex19.py
Different ways to call functions
### ex20.py
Calling functions to edit files
### ex21.py
Functions with returns and nested function use
### ex22.py
Supposed to be a scavenger hunt for all the keywords used thus far, but the README is essentially that.
### ex23.py
Recursive reading of a utf-8 encoded file
### ex24.py
Just a review of the past 23 lessons
### ex25.py
Calling functions of an imported package (that I created) through command line. Also pop() 
### ex26.py
TEST!!!!!!
### ex27.py
Calculates the results for my quiz on boolean logic (90%)
### ex28.py
Mixed up with 27. 27 has no file, 28 was the quiz. 
### ex29.py
Boolean 'if' statements
### ex30.py
If-elif-else blocks
### ex31.py
The first TBA!

## Tests
None so far
