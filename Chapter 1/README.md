## Synopsis

These exercises are basic introductory files run in PowerShell or terminal or shell to demonstrate basic Python concepts.

Simple printing exercises with lines commented out.
These exercises are from "Learning Python the Hard Way" to demonstrate and perfect Python code.

Set and evaluate constants in line with the f"String {Varliable} String"
### ex6.py
Use of the String.format() function and concatanation

First use of input()
### ex13.py
First variable input in batch line
