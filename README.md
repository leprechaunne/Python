## Motivation

I wanted to learn new languages, and was recommended Python by a friend. It's a more versatile language than Java, so it'd be beneficial for future Gists.

Basic Python IDE setup. Download Python from their website and navigate to this directory. Use the "python [filename.py]" command to run these files.

## API Reference

Default packages only, so far.

## Code Examples and Tests
