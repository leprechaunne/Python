# Python
## Synopsis
Learning Python as a scripting language for the first of the 'Four Corners of Coding'

## Descriptions
### Learning Python The Hard Way
A textbook gifted to me to learn basic commands and guidance on installing and using the command prompt more (said friend made me delete Git Desktop :( )

I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone that's coded before, but if you can stomach the monotonous work, it teachs you enough useful information and some Pythonic syntax (less is more)

### Python Arcade Game
Okay so I made a snake, and then my twin asked why I didn't name it python instead... I couldn't think of a reason so I changed it.

The only non-standard packages I use is graphics.py, because I'll be doing plenty of GUI and containers during the Full Stack Developer corner.

## Motivation

I wanted to learn new languages, and was recommended Python by a friend. It's a more versatile language than Java, so it'd be beneficial for future Gists.

## Installation

Basic Python IDE setup. Download Python from their website and navigate to this directory. Use the "python [filename.py]" command to run these files.
Conda for virtual environments, packages imported with pip

## API Reference

No programs have created an API, and the only non-pip library I've used is "Graphics.py"

## Code Examples and Tests

Are given as needed in the smallest scope directory's readme.md.
