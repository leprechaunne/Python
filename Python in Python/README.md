# Python in Python
## Synopsis

This is a simple demonstration of an OOP program of snake using a graphics API by John Zelle
It's primary purpose is to demonstrate creating a program from scratch with proper syntax

## Motivation 

Round three. I made some strange mistakes because I was trying to rewrite it all at once, 
so I'm going to do the normal incremental build


## TOREDO
### Snake moving
### Apple Spawning
### Snake growing (although this one was never fully implemented yet)

## TODO (SOON)
### 'Apple' eating
### Restrict movement OoB -- This one I've sort of done... I structured the new grid->coords method to handle it
### EDIT: snake& size increase

##TODO (EVENTUALLY)

### Add difficulty
### Apple decay
### Add Score tracking
### Add high scores
### Add visible timer
### Dynamic timer to speed up TICKS ONLY, the visible timer is for player reference
